Title
A Semi-Magic Square
Description
Form the digits 1 to 9 into a square so that if the rows are 
treated as   3 digit numbers, the sum of the first and and 
second rows equals the  third row.  If this is too easy, add the 
condition that if you rotate the  square 90 degrees clockwise, 
the sum of the new first and second  rows also equals the 
third row.
