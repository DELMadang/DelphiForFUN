Description
The grid contains matches of different 
   sizes, any of which may be     
completely unburnt, partially burnt,or    
 completly burnt.  Matches burn from   
head  to tail without skipping   
segments.  The   number ouside the   
grid indicates the  number of burnt   
segments in that row  or column.  Can 
  you shade in  the  burnt segments to  
 match the   numbers?  Source:

Letters have been assigned to 
matchsticks for use in equations

 I added letters to  the   matches and   
numbered segments to  identify the 36 
  variables used  in  equations.  So, for 
  example, match  A  has segment   
variables  A1,A2, A3,  and A4 with     
A2<=A1,  A3<=A2,etc.    This forces   
match segments to be  "burned"   
sequentially since a  segment can   
only be burned  if its  predecessor is   
already burned.
