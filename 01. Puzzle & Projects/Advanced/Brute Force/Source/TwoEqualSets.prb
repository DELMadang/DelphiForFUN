Title
Two Equal Sets
Description
Divide the numbers 1-16 into 2 pilesof eight so that their sums 
are   equal   Probably not solvable by brute force methods if 
the equation is  written as sum(8 digits)=sum(8digits).  But if 
we take advantage of  the fact that  sum for each pile must = 
1/2 of  sum(1..16)
Numbers
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16
Equations
; Next equation cannot be solved by brute force
;a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h=i+j+k+l+m+n+o+p
;This equation will solve the problem successfully
a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h=68
