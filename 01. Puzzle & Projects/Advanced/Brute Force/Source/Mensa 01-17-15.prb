Description
Two people played a game the result  
   being two unequal 3-digit scores     
which sum to 800.  Each score     
contains the the same 3 digits but  no 
   digit value is repeated within a     
score. 

What were the scores?    
Numbers
1-9
Equations
; Zero is not a possibility because 1st digits must sum to 7 plus a carry, 
; 2nd digits sum to 9 plus a carry, and 3 rd didits sum to 10   
;   
100*A+10*B+C+100*D+10*E+F=800
;Necessary (and sufficient?) condition - try it and see:
;       Pproduct of the 3 digits in each score must be equal
A*B*C=D*E*F
