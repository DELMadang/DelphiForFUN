Title
Numbered Knights
Description
Nine Knights numbered 1 through 9   
are seated at the Round Table in such 
  a way that every knight's number is 
at  least 3 higher or lower than its  
adjacent neighbor.  Also, the two  
knights at the end of the horizontal line 
 sum to an even number.  With knights 
 2, 6, and 8 seated as shown, seat the 
 rest of the knights,   

Hint: Use Absolute Value, (abs) and  
Modulo (mod) functions to define  
constraints.
