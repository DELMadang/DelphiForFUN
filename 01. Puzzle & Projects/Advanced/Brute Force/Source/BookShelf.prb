The Bookshelf Problem
Description
You have a set of 9 books labeled 1 through 9 and a     
bookshelf with   two shelves.  You notice that if you place   
volumes 6,7,2,9 on the top  shelf and 1,3,4,5,8 on the bottom  
 shelf, you create a fraction  (6729/13458) exactly equal to   
1/2.    Find other arrangements using  all nine volumes, that  
will  make fractions equal to 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6,  1/7, 1/8,  
and  1/9?  Note: Since '/' is inteeger division, equations test  
for  2,3,4,etc. times  top shelf# =bottom shelf # 
Numbers
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Equations
; Original equation before multi-digit integer recognition added
;3*(1000*a+100*b+10*c+d)=(10000*e+1000*f+100*g+10*h+i)
; Replacement equation
