I generated equations using 17    
letters "a" through "r"  which I prefilled 
  in the image at right..   On my old   
laptop, it took 30 minutes  to find the   
solution and another 15  minutes to   
verify that the solution is  unique.      

I noticed  that "j" and "k", the two    
empty squares in row three must    
each have value 10.  Prefilling those   
 squares with 10 and eliminating "j"    
and "k" variables finds the solution 10 
  times faster!  For really fast solving  
however, try "Incremental Solve".
