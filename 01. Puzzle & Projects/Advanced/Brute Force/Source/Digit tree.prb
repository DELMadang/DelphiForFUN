Digit tree
Description
Place all digits 1-9 in the circles.  Each circle must = sum of 
   the  numbers  in the circles connected to it from below.    
 Since there are 7 circles and 9 digits, I assumed that there 
  would be  two 2-digit numbers and that they are located 
as   shown here.   Each circle value will be larger than is   
connected parts, so the top circle will be a two digit  
number.    Adapted from "The Giant Book of Mensa Mind 
Challenges"    (Stirling Publications, 2003)
