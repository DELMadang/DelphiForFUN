Coin Placing
Description
Pur nickels, dimes, and quarters on  
certain squares of this grid - but no  
more than one coin per square - so  
that the coins total the amount shown 
 for eachow, column, and long  
diagonal.  Several coins (indicated by 
 their values) and one blank space  
(the star) have been placed to get  
you started.

I assigned 17 variable letters "a"  
through "q" by row and column to  
develop the equations used to solve.
