Sounds.res contains several wave sound files that may be optionally played while coasters are running.  To include the sounds in the program, 

1.  Unzip Sounds.res to the project directory for RCoaster4
2.  Remove the xxx from the 1st line in U_Coaster.pas.  I.e. {xxx$DEFINE SOUNDS} becomes {$DEFINE SOUNDS} 
3. Recompile RCoaster4.dpr
