TEXT1=The Black Hills Geocachers hosted an event that drew in geocachers from
TEXT2=all over the state.  When the time came for everyone to stand up and
TEXT3=state their nom de plumes and their hometowns, the assemblage was
TEXT4=stunned.  People, including Nighthawk43, had come from across the
TEXT5=entire state, even from Mitchell and Brandon, to attend their humble
TEXT6=event.
TEXT7=
TEXT8=When the shock wore off, the organizers realized they had recorded only
TEXT9=fragments of what people said about themselves and how many geocaches
TEXT10=were in their hometowns in the log book.  The organizers of that grand
TEXT11=event need your help to reconstruct the log book.  From the log entries
TEXT12=below, determine where each geocacher is from and how many geocaches
TEXT13=were in their hometowns on that day.
TEXT14=
TEXT15=1. Rcsearcher left his home in Newell to attend the event, which has
TEXT16=exactly 8 more geocaches than AccordianGal’s hometown but fewer
TEXT17=geocaches than the 36 geocaches to be found in Pierre.  EskoClimber
TEXT18=isn’t from the town with 40 geocaches.
TEXT19=
TEXT20=2. Team BC is not from Jefferson or Aberdeen. Jedi Cacher traveled from
TEXT21=his home in De Smet.  DakotaHillbillies’s hometown (which has 52
TEXT22=geocaches) is either Aberdeen or Redfield.
TEXT23=
TEXT24=3. Neither Buckton Cachers (who aren't from the town with 40 geocaches)
TEXT25=nor EskoClimber (who isn’t from Pierre) are the ones who are from
TEXT26=Jefferson that has 24 geocaches.
TEXT27=
TEXT28=4. Pear Head (whose hometown doesn’t have either 40 or 48 geocaches) is
TEXT29=either the one from Eureka or the one from Tripp.
TEXT30=
TEXT31=5. Momof6furrballs (whose hometown has more than 24 geocaches) is not
TEXT32=the one from Aberdeen or the one from Redfield.  EskoClimber’s hometown
TEXT33=doesn’t have 32, 48, or 56 geocaches.  Buckton Cachers’s hometown
TEXT34=doesn’t have 32 or 36 geocaches.
TEXT35=
TEXT36=6. Exactly two people have the same initial as that of their hometown.
