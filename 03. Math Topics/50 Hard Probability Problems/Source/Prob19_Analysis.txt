 The solution requires that we compute the probabilities of successful outcomes for three different experiments, call them Part A, Part B, and Part C.
For Part A, we roll six dice (or one die 6 times) and count success if 1 or more sixes appear.  The easiest approach for the "N or more" class of problems is often to compute the probability of "fewer than N" and subtract that number from 1.00 since one or the other of those cases must occur.  In this case we'll calculate 1 - P(0 occurences of a six in 6 rolls).For each roll the probability of a number that is not a six is 5 in 6 (5/6).  Since the outcomes are all independent, we can multiply the individual outcomes to find the overall probability.  In this case, the chance of no sixes in 6 rolls is 5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 or (5/6) to the 6th power, (5/6)^6 = 0.33490.Our Part A probability is therefore 1-0.33490 = 0.6651Part B is a little more complicated: We now need to subtract the probabilities of zero sixes and of 1 six from 1.00 to find the probability of 2 or more sixes in 12 rolls. P(0 sixes in 12 rolls)= (5/6)^12 = 0.11215.  P(of a six on the 1st roll and 11 non-sixes)=1/6 x (5/6)^11 = 0.02243.  But since the single six can be in any of the 12 rolls, we need to multiply by 12 (= 0.26918).So the Part B probability of 2 or more sixes in 12 rolls is 1 - 0.11215 - 0.26918 = 0.61867.  Slightly less than the 1st case.
Finally, for Part C, the probability of 3 or more sixes in 18 rolls, we will extend the previous technique by subtracting the probabilities of 0, 1, or 2 sixes in 18 rolls from 1.00.  The first two are similar to our previous calculations: p(0 in 18) = (5/6)^18 = 0.03756 and P(1 in 18)= 1/6 x (5/6)^17 x 18 = 0.13522. For the "3  sixes out of 18 rolls" case, we can calculate 1/6 (chance of a six on the first roll) x 1/6 (chance of six in position 2) x (5/6)^16 (chance of no sixes in the other 16). But since the first six can occur in any of the 18 rolls and the second inany of the remaining 17, we need to multiply the previous calulation by the number of ways to pick 2 roll numbers out if 18, we need to multiply by the number of ways 2 can be chosen from 18, which is 18 (for the 1st six) 17 x (for the 2nd six) divided by 2 (since order of the two sixes is immaterial).

The Part C probability of 3 or more sixes in 18 rolls is therefore 1.000 - 0.03756 - 0.13522 - 0.22987 = 0.59735, smallest of the three cases.
