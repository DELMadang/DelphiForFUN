Problem 17 Theory:   If A and B are to play each other, it will be in Round 1, 2, or 3.

Well analyze the probability of meeting for each round separately and sum them to get the overall number.  For Round 1, A can be in any position and there is a 1 in 7 (1/7) chance that B will be in the opponent position.

If they did not meet in Round 1, then the chances of meeting in Round 2 will be "the chance that they didn't meet" (6/7) x "the chance that A won his match" (1/2) X "the chance that B won his match" (1/2) X "the chance that they play each other in Round 2" (1/3), 1/3 because A can be in any of the 4 positions and there is 1 chance in 3 that B will be in the slot opposing him.  So the chance of A vs B in Round 2 is 6/7 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/3 = 1/14.

For Round 3 they both must have survived Round 1 (6/7x1/4) x  "and did not play each other in Round 2" (2/3) x "chance that both won their round 2 games (1/4). So Round 3 chance is 6/7 X 1/4 X 2/3 X 1/4 = 1/28.

Overall chance of meeting therefore is 1/7+1/14+1/28 or 7/28 = 1/4.  Can this be correct? Run the 1,000,000 simulated trials to find out.
